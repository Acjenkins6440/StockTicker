# Stock Ticker

This app shows 90 and 30 day historical stock data for three selectable stocks.  

### Tracking a new stock

In order to start tracking a new stock, just pick one from the dropdown at the top of the graph.

### Entering Ticker Mode

Ticker mode fetches the last few hours of trade data, and then starts appending real-time trades to the end of the graph.  (Websocket in progress)
